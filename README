What's it all about?
====================

So the general idea here is to provide an interface to control an application
by email. Let's look at a very simple example.

Imagine you have defined the following class:

    class Server
    {
        public function restartServices(array $services, $force = false)
        {
            // Restart services ...
        }
    }
    
We can represent this definition within an email:

    What?               Origin?                     Example?
    -----               -------                     --------
    class name          "to" header value           "server@example.org"
    method name         "subject" header value      "restart services"
    arguments           message body                "services[] = mysql
                                                    services[] = apache
                                                    force = true"

This mapping is the goal of MailControl. Let's do this!

Run unit tests:

    phpunit standalone/tests
